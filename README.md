Flask News Sentiment Analyzer is a simple web app that reads news from a CSV file, checks if each article feels positive, negative, or neutral using VADER NLP, and shows the results in a clean dashboard you can filter. Built with Flask, Pandas, and Bootstrap, it makes understanding news sentiment quick and easy.
